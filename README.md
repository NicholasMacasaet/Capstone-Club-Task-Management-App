# Project Setup Instructions

## Frontend/Backend Setup
- First, clone the repository. You can use whatever method you prefer but I use github desktop since its easy.
- Open up the terminal in your editor. 
- Navigate to the root level of the directory and type `cd Task_Manager_Frontend` (for setting up Frontend) or `cd Task_Manager_Backend` to set up the frontend or backend of the application.
- You will need npm (Node Package Manager), so follow the installation guide [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for your respective machine and come back to this once you've done so.
- Once you've changed directories and are in either the respective frontend or backend directory, type `npm install` and any dependencies needed should be automatically downloaded to your local machine.

## IMPORTANT
- I've done this by mistake a handful of times but do NOT touch the .gitignore files and commit the node_modules folder or else hundreds of files will be committed and that'll be bad™
